```
I want to create a mini-app "FlashBase Bets": Ultra-fast 5–60 minute prediction markets on anything (next influencer tweet, price flips, drama). One-tap entry with USDC/ETH on Base, instant settlements.
For all markets and every big win auto-posts a sleek result frame to Farcaster with profit badge and invite link. Users can create markets in seconds and share directly to Farcaster. Top traders leaderboard auto-casts weekly. Referral rewards explode growth. Minimalist dark UI, meme thumbnails. 
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app title and description.

A minimalist dark‑themed logo for FlashBase Bets featuring a stylized betting chip with a glowing neon outline, a subtle Base network icon, and a dynamic arrow indicating rapid predictions. The background is a deep charcoal gradient with a faint pixelated pattern, and the logo is centered with a sleek, modern font for the app name below the icon.
